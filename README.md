## Hi, here, there, and everywhere! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate student at Sichuan University. I'm looking for oppotunities to pursue my Msc. degree.

- ðŸ”­ My research interest focuses on machine learning and data mining. Specifically, I aim to discover valuable insights from various types of data using artificial-intelligence learning tools and apply these findings in specific fields. So far, I have been extensively involved in tasks spanning various fields, including **computer vision**, **recommendation systems**, **large language models**, **anomaly detection**, **multi-view clustering**, etc.
