## Hi, here, there, and everywhere! 👋

I'm an undergraduate student. I will continue my graduate career at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

- 🔭 My research interest focuses on machine learning and data mining. Specifically, I aim to discover valuable insights from various modalities of data from a statistical, data-centric viewpoint, designing algorithms and architectures to apply these findings in specific down-streaming tasks.  So far, I've been involved in tasks spanning several fields, including *computer vision*, *multimodal learning*, *large language models*, and *recommendation systems*.
- 🌱 Recently, I've been working on: 1) _the practice of multimodal large language models (MLLMs/VLMs)_; 2) _model post-training under realistic scenarios (e.g., non-i.i.d. data streams, limited classes, noisy labels)_; and 3) _interdisciplinary exploration with AI techniques_.
- 📫 If you are seeking guidance/discussion oppotunity on career planning or educational development among peers, or interested in potential academic exchanges and collaborations, please feel free to [contact me](huangjiazhen1125@gmail.com).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a long-distance running enthusiast 🏃, fan of Manchester United ⚽; I also hope to become an outstanding amateur baritone singer or guitarist 🎵
